The iron ore found at the Mont d\u2019Orzeires and the Vall\u00e9e de Joux, the large local forests for charcoal and the flowing water that provided hydraulic energy are the reasons that this first establishment came to be. There were three bloomeries at Vallorbe; and then three blast furnaces which produced cast iron, which could be used right away or refined in another furnace called a finery forge, to produce wrought iron which could then be forged. All around workshops and small forges appeared, often in farms, where tools, weapons, chains, nails, horseshoes and other iron items for the building trade were all produced. At Vallorbe, the blast furnaces died away before 1700, because the open iron pits were exhausted and the forests disappeared. From then on the raw materials had to be imported to allow the continued development of the iron industry. For many centuries, Vallorbe became the centre of the iron industry in the Canton of Vaud and very much earned its nickname as \u201cThe City of iron\u201d. At the end of the 18th century, 70% of Vallorbians of working age made their living from the iron industry. They then began to specialise in file manufacturing. The file is an essential tool for watchmakers, music box makers and the other precision mechanics that prospered across the entire Jura region. To this day, the \u201cUsines M\u00e9tallurgiques de Vallorbe\u201d (UMV) is a world leader in the production of precision files.<\/p><p>Now, let us look at the industrial canal at the Grand Forges, and, on your screen, at some old and some more recent photographs of the site. In 1495, the prior of Romainm\u00f4tier, Michel de Savoie, gave Pierre Vallotton, known as Develley, permission to use the water, dig a canal and install hydraulically powered machines. The flow of water from the river must be controllable to allow undershot water wheels to be built; in front of each wheel, the plank of wood or steel regulate the flow of water to control the speed of the wheel\u2019s rotation. Six wheels were functioning on the canal at the beginning of the 20th century, all completely restored; there were two left when Valentin Viotti closed the enterprise in 1967, and one for the Estoppey Forge, opposite. The site, classed as a historical monument, is a testimony to the development of the iron industry at Vallorbe. The Grand Forges, or Town Forges, which were constantly being transformed, were home to a blast furnace from 1528 to 1697.<\/p><p>I, Jean-Marius Chaulmontet, will take over and guide you through the two last floors of the museum. You will relive the epic story of the railway at Vallorbe, from the first convoy that I had the honour of receiving in 1870, right up to the TGVs (high speed trains) of today. A superb 20 minute film will tell you all about this fascinating story.<\/p><p>But first follow my colleague Vulcain inside.<\/p>","tag":

This block of melted nails is a testimony, as are the photographs on your screen, to the violence of the great fire of Vallorbe. On the 7th April 1883 the weather was dry and there was a strong wind, a fire broke out very close to where we are now, at the bottom of the Grand Rue; it destroyed 93 buildings and spread out towards the west. The disaster provoked a great outburst of generosity in Switzerland and abroad! There were also political consequences\u2026 Just imagine, the Canton of Vaud allowed itself to borrow the entirety of the Canton\u2019s fire insurance savings fund! The nails you see exhibited here melted in their original storage case.<\/p><p>By 1883, there were only a few nail makers left in Vallorbe. This was due to the new nail making machines, which, from the 19th century, sent prices crashing! But in around 1800 there were still 70 nail makers in the village. On one of the panels in front of you, the land register from 1818 lists four nail factories in the Grand Forges alone.<\/p><p>A bit later on in your visit, you will discover the tools and techniques used for forging handmade nails. This was one of the specialities of the Grand Forges. A skilful nail maker could, depending on their size, forge more than 1\u2019500 nails a day. The blacksmiths from our museum have mastered these techniques: the Lat\u00e9nium at Neuch\u00e2tel placed an order with them for 6\u2019000 nails to reconstruct a Gallo Roman boat that is almost 20 metres long and was built in 182 AD, the remains of which were discovered in the bay of Bevaix.<\/p>","tag":

In each part there was a hearth for forging nails. There would be several nail makers grouped around each fire to make efficient use of the charcoal\u2026 You can imagine the working conditions! Heat, smoke, noise and bad lighting. The dim light allowed the craftsmen to see the colour of the heated iron so they would know exactly when a metal rod was at the right temperature for forging.<\/p><p>Let\u2019s start with the small window. You can see a selection of ore samples. At Vallorbe, limonite was melted, which has a low iron count (n\u00b02), and hematite, which is richer (n\u00b07). At the Mont d\u2019Orzeires, the Charbonni\u00e8res and the Risoux, \u201cmines\u201d were in operation, which were really just simple trenches dug out in the open; the ore was brought down from the Vall\u00e9e de Joux on carts, as was the charcoal.<\/p><p>Now let\u2019s turn around and go further back, to a time after the Bronze Age, the beginning of the Iron Age in our region, about 2\u2019500 years ago. Behind this long window there are lots of things to observe! Vallorbe didn\u2019t yet exist. But very close by, at the Bellaires, above La Sarraz, the first bloomeries started to appear in 350 BC. Be sure to examine n\u00b01, a cutting implement found at Chevroux (close to Payerne). This object dates back to between the Bronze and Iron Ages! Only the blade is made of iron, very sharp and quite rare, so more expensive than bronze which was used for the handle! Now look at n\u00b04, this is what we call the \u201csalmon\u201d of the bloomer; it was in this state that the iron was sold and that the blacksmith would have bought his raw materials. Now direct your attention to n\u00b09, and admire the Burgundy belt buckles richly encrusted with silver.<\/p>","tag":

It leant against the hill to facilitate the loading of baskets of iron ore and charcoal from above. This blast furnace, at the Grand Forges, remained in use for more than 150 years, until 1697! Once a batch was ready, the blast furnace was opened from below and the cast iron was then poured into moulds made of sand. This is the way that the three chimney plaques on the walls would have been cast, and also many cannon balls like the ones that are exhibited here\u2026<\/p><p>If you have time, we recommend that you press the button to start the film, which runs for 13 minutes\u2026 You will be able to experience the history of the iron industry at Vallorbe that we briefly outlined at the beginning of your visit.<\/p><p>Dwell upon the three dimensional map and the various items that are exhibited. We are going to look at two of them, which are quite amazing:<\/p><p>The first is the \u201cbanderette\u201d. Vincent Vallotton, owner of the Grand Forges, was named \u201cLord of the manor\u201d of Vallorbe by the governor of Bern in Romainm\u00f4tier. \u201cLord of the manor\u201d did not necessarily mean that he owned a manor, but simply that he was the president of the local court of justice. In 1568, his employees forged this large iron column. He then positioned it on the wooden bridge slightly upstream, which was the only one that crossed the river Orbe. It served as a flag post and a pillory. According to tales passed down through the centuries, Vallorbians who were convicted by the court of justice would be chained to the column with a sign around their neck that explained the reason for them being there.<\/p><p>The second item is a \u201cmilitary gun\u201d assembled in Bern for the city guard. By reading the information next to the window, you can learn about the interesting journey that this weapon made before arriving back at Vallorbe. The barrel was forged and drilled at the Eterpaz, downstream from the Grand Forges, in Abraham Jaquet\u2019s \u201cgun barrel factory\u201d. From 1747, Their Excellences from Bern ordered several thousands of these guns which assured the prosperity of this Vallorbian enterprise!<\/p>","tag":

Scythes and hay cutting instruments were forged there until 1956. The drawings show how the craftsman laid out his steel, often sitting on a plank of wood suspended in front of his hammer.<\/p><p>As for the second enterprise, it can be found just downstream from Vallorbe, at the Eterpaz. A forge was built there in 1675, on a canal that branched off from the river Orbe. Little by little it became a complex of factories which stayed active until 1959! The range of tools forged was immense. The last panel of the series gives you an idea of this. For a short time before and after 1900, with the hallmark L+C Vallorbes (still spelt with an \u2018s\u2019) marked on the blade, the famous Swiss army knife was produced there. Now, pay particular attention to object n\u00b024, and your screen. These shears for cutting barbed wire symbolise the horror of the battles that occurred in the trenches during the First World War. They were sold to both the sides that were fighting each other, and made a huge contribution to the success of the Eterpaz.<\/p><p>The same can be said for the Usines M\u00e9tallurgiques de Vallorbe and the file, which was an essential tool for factories producing guns and other weapons. During the Second World War, thanks to written and signed international agreements at the highest level, sales to the Nazis more than doubled whilst the United States continued to import a quarter of the UMV\u2019s entire output between 1939 and 1945!

Look for the inscription JV 1931 engraved in the wall. Jules\u2019 father, Valentino, had owned the building next door since 1910, which has now become the Tourist Information Office. Jules\u2019 son Valentin closed the Grand Forges in 1967 and started a metallic construction company in the Jurats.<\/p><p>If you look at your screen you will see what working with iron has become today. Long ago, watchmakers were often blacksmiths before transferring to a new career with a better remuneration package! This can be seen frequently in notary registers dating from the 18th century at the Vall\u00e9e de Joux. Artistic ironwork still prospers today. Stroke the griffin exhibited here!
